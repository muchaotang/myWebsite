<div class="sqs-block-content"><h3>Problem Story</h3><p><span style="font-size:11.000000pt">Our protagonist Jeremy is a new MS-HCI student. He is enjoying his cozy life in Atlanta before he is introduced to a huge number of platforms. During his study life in Georgia Tech, he encounters a lot of problems </span></p></div>

<div class="sqs-block-content"><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>Introduction</h3><p>Currently, GaTech MS-HCI students are using a multitude of online mediums to seek information, communicate and get answers to their queries. The prominent communication and information seeking mediums include social media platforms like Slack, WhatsApp, We Chat, Facebook Messenger and groups, Google hangouts as well as Email, T-Square and Forums like Piazza.</p><p>Our major <strong>Research Goals</strong> were to understand the student’s information needs, ease of access and issues with regards to prominent mediums being used for seeking information and based on these understanding of needs propose design concepts and interventions to fulfill them. Based on our objective, the following research questions were under consideration in our study:</p><p>● What are the most prominent mediums among students to access information? What are major types of information being asked for a certain medium and why?<br>● What are the major issues being faced by the students while seeking information through these mediums and why?<br>● How do differences in the difference in nationality might affect preference of a medium and their usage?</p></div>

<div class="sqs-block-content"><h3>Competitive analysis</h3><p>The competitive analysis overall helped us understand the strengths and weakness of prominent communication platforms. This understanding helped in us to cater for improvement in our design concept solution</p></div>

<div class="sqs-block-content"><h3>User Research</h3><p>In this section we describe the user centered design methods we followed to identify our user needs and problems.</p><ul dir="ltr"><li>Semi-Structured interviews</li><li>Affinity mapping</li><li>Surveys</li><li>Follow-up interviews</li><li>Data Analysis</li></ul></div>

<div class="sqs-block-content"><h3>findings&nbsp;</h3><p>Information is overloaded.</p><p>It is hard to get the information they need.</p><p>Relevant responses is not accessible.</p><p>Slack for all.</p><p>Ineffective online collaboration and communication.</p></div>

<div class="sqs-block-content"><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>Concept story</h3><p>In the concept story, our protagonist Jeremy encounters the same problems. However, this time, we introduce our new product ‘Mlagic’. ‘Mlagic’ provides some significant services that can be used to facilitate him in information seeking, communication and collaboration.</p></div>

<div class="sqs-block-content"><h3>&nbsp;</h3><h3>Conclusion</h3><p>-There is a real need for a more integrated platform to facilitate MS-HCI students in seeking information, communicating and collaborating.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>-Slack for all, with need for categorization and prioritization to facilitate relevant information for MS-HCI students.</p><p>-Facilitating effective collaboration and scheduling on platforms</p><h3>&nbsp;</h3><h3>2016/10/19 UPDATE</h3><p>Surprise!&nbsp;</p><p>2 weeks after our final presentation, Slack integrated parts of Google drive functions like creating Gdocs and importing docs from Gdrive inside the group discussion! It matched our design suggestion!</p></div>
