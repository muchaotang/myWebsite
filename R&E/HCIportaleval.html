<div class="sqs-block-content"><h3>Introduction</h3><p>After initial interviews and surveys were conducted to understand current problems with the large number of information platforms available to MS-HCI students, the next step was to gather feedback about the prototypes that were designed to address some of those concerns.</p><p>The overall goal of the tests were to assess the usability of this new system for MS-HCI students. More specifically, the team set out with three main goals:<br>1. Clarity and consistency of UI elements<br>2. Users’ mental models and decision making processes<br>3. Overall perceived usefulness, ease-of-use, and intent to use</p><h3>&nbsp;</h3><h3>Session design</h3><p><strong>Participants</strong></p><p>Five MS-HCI students (3 first-year, 2 second-year) participated in feedback sessions. There were two student from the Interactive Computer track, two from Industrial Design, and one from Psychology.</p><p><br><strong>Research Methods</strong></p><p>A <strong>card sorting</strong> task was used to assess the user’s perception of the MS-HCI portal’s information architecture. Participants were instructed to sort a randomly-ordered list of 27 items into four preset bins: Registration, Communication, Resources, and Unsure. These bin titles corresponded to the high-level labels used to organize the MS-HCI portal, along with a catch-all category for items that participants were not sure where to sort. The 27 card sort items selected from key elements and features of the wireframes. These items were designed to be representative of the content found in the MS-HCI portal.</p><p><strong>Interview </strong>questions and <strong>benchmark tasks</strong> were used to gather feedback on the wireframes. The wireframes were presented on six sheets of letter-sized paper. While interacting with the paper wireframes, participants gave verbal responses to interview questions designed to assess their feedback. Interview questions were organized around the three major areas-of-interest described above.</p><p>To assess the usability of the MS-HCI portal, we used a standardized measure called the <strong>System Usability Scale (SUS)</strong>. The SUS is a widely used 10-item questionnaire, originally developed by John Brooke in 1986. Each item consists of a simple usability statement to which participants responded on a 5-point Likert scale (Strongly Disagree to Strongly Agree).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>Findings</h3><p>Each of the participants in our feedback study did card sorting, was interviewed, and filled out a survey. After gathering feedback from all the participants, our next step was analyzing the data captured by all the participants using affinity mapping online tool Stickies.io.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Communication</strong></p><p>For communications page, the two key insights we gathered from all the participants were.</p><p>● The understandings of Announcements, Q&amp;A, Grad students were different for each user. Some users thought that they could post their question in Q&amp;A, some thought that the Q&amp;A section was based on class questions and then some admin would post those questions later on since students did not have an option to post.<br>● Students prefer/need a formal channel to contact the faculty. They are little uncomfortable sending direct messages to them and they would prefer to send the message as an email rather than chat.<br>● Students didn’t expect the communication and direct message list to disappear when switching the pages.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Registration</strong></p><p>The key insights for the registration page were as follows</p><p>● The interface did not support accessing information about previous semesters.<br>● The calendar feature proved to be very useful, but can be made more useful<br>● The progress bar to depict the progress in registration is continuous in current design which is counter-intuitive due to the discrete nature of the course credits.<br>● The current system does not support any mechanism to track the progress status of the request permit forms and equipments status.<br>● All the participants thought that the registration on the system was just a simulation of the actual registration and the calendar was also there to simulate possible time tables</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Resources</strong></p><p>The major insights from the resources page were as follows.</p><p>● There are no resources sections for the jobs and internships<br>● The forms do not look like a form and the visual appearance does not match with preconceived mental model of the form to the user. Moreover, the horizontal layout of the form makes it difficult for a user to track the question and options.<br>● There was very less information about the labs in the lab section. Students expected to see Lab focus; available equipment; who is in charge, contact info; open time, etc. in the labs section.<br>● There was no way to track the progress of the form requests.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Notifications</strong></p><p>The notifications were confusing to the users and following are the key insights from this feature.</p><p>● Students were unclear about the identity of users who sent them messages in the notification section.<br>● Different users have different notification preferences for the amount and type of notification they want to receive. Some users wanted to receive notification for all the activities related to them and some users wanted to prioritize and filter the notification.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>General feedback</strong></p><p>● The similarity with the Slack interface give the users some presumptions of the portal that this is just a communication tool and most users struggled to find Registration and Resources section at one glance.<br>● Some of the sections in resources page were extraneous and could have been removed to give space to more important stuff like labs.<br>● Multiple search bars confuse students about their scope. A search bar above the Direct messages confused student whether they can search everything in that search bar.<br>● The switching between pages was not intuitive and involved more effort than required.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>Design suggestion</h3></div>

<div class="sqs-block-content"><p><strong>Design Recommendation 1</strong></p><p>Add schedule icon on the top right along with the notification icon, users can check their schedule by clicking the icon. If they want to add/delete event, they can click the button and edit their schedule</p><p><strong>Justification</strong></p><p>3 out of 5 participants mentioned that they like the calendar in the ‘Registration’ page, but it was only for schedule the courses they are taking the next semester. Since they might not use the ‘Registration’ page often after they finish planning for their next semester, it is more convenient for them to check and update their schedule from any page if we place it on navigation bar.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Design Recommendation 2</strong></p><p>Use tabs on the top to navigate across pages.</p><p><strong>Justification</strong></p><p>There are user feedback saying that they do not expect there to be other major pages other than communication, due to their former experience of using Slack. As a result, we think it makes more sense to show the access to other 2 pages more obviously.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Design Recommendation 3</strong></p><p>Use names instead of username in the direct message notifications.</p><p><strong>Justification</strong></p><p>3 out of our 5 interviewees said that they cannot easily figure out where the direct message came from because they didn’t recognize the username in the DM notification. Using name instead of username will make the information more intuitive to users.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Design Recommendation 4</strong></p><p>Rearrange the information of the labs, more about projects and vacancy in projects. Change the way to show the link of the lab website.</p><p><strong>Justification</strong></p><p>&nbsp;All 5 participants mentioned that the information about labs is too little, they want to know more about the projects. The affinity mapping shows that students are mostly interested in information about the on-going projects and research opportunities. Therefore we recommend to add those information into the page. Also there is also a low probability for the icon linked to the website to be noticed. Some interviewee didn’t find the icon when they were asked to tell how they would get more information about the lab, instead they tried to search the lab in google. Therefore we move the link to the content part of the page, and add the link address to make it more noticeable.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Design Recommendation 5</strong></p><p>Indicate the status of permit process in the ‘Registration’ page</p><p><strong>Justification</strong></p><p>Interviewees mentioned that they would like to receive feedback of the permit process status after they sent the course permit request. The feedback should not only indicate when permits are granted, but also show the intermediate processes. We recommend the ‘REQUEST PERMIT’ button change according to the permit process status. After a student clicks the button and sends a request, it becomes disable and shows the status. So that student would know if they have sent the request successfully, or if the permit granting process is working smoothly.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Design Recommendation 6</strong></p><p>Progress bar in the ‘Registration’ page in the form of a bar of separate boxes. When a course is added to the calendar, the credits show in the progress bar in a fade color.</p><p><strong>Justification</strong></p><p>One participant mentioned that the progress bar is not intuitive design for it is not a continuous process in choosing courses. The process is in the form of discrete credits. Some say that simply texts can serve the function well. To make the visualization more intuitive and easier to understand, we design it to be composed of a bar of separate boxes.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Design Recommendation 7</strong></p><p>Change the form layout.</p><p><strong>Justification</strong></p><p>Most interviewee mentioned that the form didn’t look like an official form to them. The description looks merging into the form part and one of the interviewees said she didn’t realize the bottom part was the actual form. They mentioned that they prefer to see a vertical layout rather than a horizontal one because vertical layout is typical for forms. We recommend to add a border to the form so it is separated from the description. Since there are not many contents in this form, it is not very likely to make it vertical. So we recommend increase the spacing to make the form visually vertically extended.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Design Recommendation 8</strong></p><p>Create a page displaying detailed course information and student feedbacks after the user click a specific course in the ‘Registration’ page.</p><p><strong>Justification</strong></p><p>Users in our tests struggled to read text in the sidebar area, suggesting that these areas would have larger problems when used by those with vision impairments. Thus, our solution would increase the contrast of the text-to-background in the areas where users seemed to have the greatest difficulty. In addition, the icons used to indicate status would pose issues when those with difficulty deciphering colors might see them. Therefore, having icons that changed along with the status color would allow an additional way for users to detect status. While the above rendering uses hollow circles and an “Away” description, other icons and color variations could be used, like a red “X” (however, this was thought this might suggest a user would be deleting a conversation with that person if clicked).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Accessibility Design Recommendation 2</strong></p><p>Redesign the side panel to have more visible titles and search descriptions. Additionally, substitute the green and gray circle icons with icons that signify status without the use of color.</p><p><strong>Justification</strong></p><p>There is a ‘show more’ button near some courses on the ‘Registration’ page, and it is vague what will happen after clicking the button. Moreover, we find that users want to get some suggestions from the students who took specific courses before.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Accessibility Design Recommendation 2</strong></p><p>Increase font size of the description in each subtitle area. In the above rendering, the title’s size is increased with all subtitle text removed entirely, until the user hovers over or clicks the “i” information icon, where a description of the current page appears with the subtitle description text in a larger font size.</p><p><strong>Justification</strong></p><p>An analysis of the wireframes brought up issues over the font size of the description text in each window. Small font sizes may be difficult to read by those with visual impairments. By removing this description text and showing it only when requested, we can increase the font size of the title of the page, as well as provide a popup with the description in a larger font size.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p></div>
